# DS vs NNC vs NMC
The idea of the project is to program several machine learning algorithms and compare their work. The following algorithms were selected: Decision Tree Classifier, Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Nearest Mean Classifier.

# k-NN Perfomance Boosting
The purpose of the project is to accelerate the operation of a machine learning algorithm using Numpy library. The algorithm chosen is k Nearest Neighbors.

# Memory Overflow
Machine learning algorithms often feature an exponent, which leads to memory overflow and loss of accuracy. The goal of this project is to transform the operation of algorithms to avoid memory overflow, with minimal loss of classification accuracy.

# Markov Chain
The project purpose is the simulation and optimization of work with Markov chains.
